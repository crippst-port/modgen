WEEK DATES (Based on Course Start Date):
The course has a start date set in Moodle. Each week is 7 days from the previous week.
Include the week date range in each week's title using this format:
Instead of: "Week 1"
Use: "{START_DATE} - {END_DATE}"
Then: "{START_DATE} - {END_DATE}"
Then: "{START_DATE} - {END_DATE}"
And so on for each subsequent week.
IMPORTANT: Use the exact date format shown above (e.g., "Jan 6 - Jan 12").
IMPORTANT: Each week is exactly 7 days after the previous week.
