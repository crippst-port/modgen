*** USER SPECIFIED: Generate EXACTLY {THEME_COUNT} themes - this is a HARD REQUIREMENT ***
Divide ALL topics into {THEME_COUNT} coherent theme groups (typically 2-4 weeks per theme).
- Do NOT generate more or fewer than {THEME_COUNT} themes
- This overrides any other guidance about theme count (like 'typically 3-6')
- Theme titles MUST describe the actual content/topic - NEVER use generic names like 'Theme 1', 'Theme 2', 'Module 1', etc.
- CRITICAL: Each theme must have a descriptive title (e.g., 'Theme: Data Analysis Fundamentals', 'Theme: Cloud Computing Architecture', 'Theme: User Interface Design')
- NEVER output: 'Theme 1', 'Theme 2', 'Theme 3', 'Module 1', 'Part 1', or any generic numbered theme titles
- Week titles must include topic/concept (e.g., 'Week 1: Data Structures and Types')
- Verify every topic from source appears in at least one week
- Theme summary: 2-3 sentence student introduction
- Week summary: brief overview of learning outcomes
- Distribute activities across pre-session/session/post-session appropriately
