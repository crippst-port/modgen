$string['activityguidanceinstructions'] = 'ACTIVITY GUIDANCE AND COHERENCE - CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

AUDIENCE: All summaries, guidance, and activity descriptions must be written for UK UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. Use appropriate academic language and assume prior tertiary-level education.

ACTIVITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Each week MUST include AT LEAST ONE activity, maximum 5 Moodle activities per week (or as many as the content supports, up to 5)
- External links and face-to-face activities do not count toward the activity limit and can be included as described below
- The number and type of activities should be led by the topic complexity and learning outcomes
- All suggested activities MUST be pedagogically sound and evidence-based
- Focus on the learning outcome, and naturally reference the activity when it helps clarify the task

EXTERNAL LINKS (URLs):
- Use external links to direct students to reading materials, reference websites, videos, multimedia content, or context related to other activities
- External links do NOT count toward the activity limit and can be used liberally to supplement learning
- Examples: "Review the X article to understand background", "Watch the X video for context before the quiz", "Use the X database for references"
- Include externalurl field with full URL (e.g., "https://example.com")

FACE-TO-FACE ACTIVITIES:
- If the module includes face-to-face components, include these as descriptive text in the weekly summary
- Face-to-face activities do NOT require associated Moodle activities
- Examples in weekly summary: "Attend the Wednesday 2pm lecture on X topic", "Complete face-to-face group work in lab session", "Present findings in class"
- Keep descriptions clear about timing, location expectations, and learning purpose

1. IN EACH WEEKLY/SECTION SUMMARY, YOU MUST:
   - Clearly describe what students will learn and do this week
   - Explain the LEARNING PURPOSE of each element (what concept or skill it develops)
   - Provide HOW TO APPROACH guidance (what students should do first, then next, etc.)
   - Explain what students will gain or be able to do after engaging with the activities
   - Use natural, conversational language appropriate for university students
   - Reference activities by name when it aids clarity, e.g., "Use the [Activity Name] book to read about X" or "Take the [Activity Name] quiz to check your understanding"
   - Include any face-to-face activities as natural descriptions of in-class or on-campus activities
   - Reference external reading links when they provide important context or prerequisites

2. IN EACH ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION, YOU MUST:
   - Expand on and reinforce the learning purposes from the weekly summary
   - Provide specific, practical guidance for engaging with the activity
   - Link back to the learning objectives mentioned in the summary
   - Make the activity description coherent and naturally flowing from the summary

3. COHERENCE REQUIREMENT:
   - The weekly summary and activity descriptions MUST tell a consistent story
   - Students should understand not just WHAT to do, but WHY they are doing it and what it contributes to their learning
   - Guidance must flow logically from week-level overview to specific activity engagement
   - External links should be naturally woven in to support the learning narrative

PEDAGOGICAL SOUNDNESS:
- Activities should align with Bloom\'s taxonomy (remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate, create)
- Vary activity types throughout the week to maintain student engagement
- Ensure activities build progressively toward the learning outcomes
- Consider diverse learning preferences (visual, auditory, kinesthetic, reading/writing)

EXAMPLE SUMMARY FORMAT: "This week you\'ll explore [Topic] through structured learning. Begin by reviewing the [URL Name] article for background context, then use the [Name] book to read about [concept], which helps you understand [key idea]. You\'ll then take the [Name] quiz to check your understanding and identify areas for deeper engagement. Attend the Wednesday lecture on [topic] to discuss applications with peers. By working through these elements, you\'ll develop [learning outcome]."

LANGUAGE GUIDELINES:
- Write for mature learners; avoid patronising or overly simple language
- Focus on learning outcomes and intellectual development, but can naturally reference activity names when helpful
- Use natural phrases like "explore," "investigate," "develop understanding" combined with activity references where appropriate
- Examples: "Use the X book to...", "Work through the X quiz to...", "Discuss in the X forum how...", "Review the X link for...", "Explore the X resource to...", "Review the X reading to understand...", "Attend the X lecture to..."
- Vary your sentence structure and phrasing to maintain engagement
- Be specific about what students will learn, not just what they\'ll do

IMPORTANT - DO NOT USE LABELS:
- Never include "label" activity types in your response - they are not learning activities
- Labels are content display containers, not pedagogical activities
- All items in the "activities" array must be real learning activities (quiz, book, forum, url, assignment, etc.)
- If you need to display important information, use a different activity type or include it in the section summary instead';
